About Me:

I started getting interested in programming back in 8th grade when I created my first website using only HTML and CSS. In college, I got introduced to Python, and I fell in love with it due to its understandable syntax and multitasking capabilities. Currently, I am actively searching for a job that would help me further develop towards full-stack development.

I am passionate about time management. In my work, I am responsible: I strive to complete every task I take on.

I also have a hobby - in my free time, I study topics that interest me (mostly related to IT), write articles on them, and participate in various conferences. As a result, I can boast of having 10 published articles.
